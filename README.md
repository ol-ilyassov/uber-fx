A repository to practice work with the following library:

## Get started

[**uber-go/fx**] - a dependency injection module based on application framework for Go.

Fx functionality provides:
* reduce boilerplate in setting up your application;
* eliminate global state in your application;
* add new components and have them instantly accessible across the application;
* build general purpose shareable modules that just work.

## Installation

Install Go module in application:
```
go get go.uber.org/fx@latest
```
